# Westfront PC

This was passed to me via email back in 2006. 

My original intent was to port this to something more modern
an attempt to preserve it.

I never got around to it, but afer I recently learned that Paul
had passed, I thought it was important to post this.

This is written in Powerbasic

Below is the original README file.

The main source file for Westfront PC is: WFTST.BAS

This MAY change in the future, but it will always be the FIRST
source code file (.BAS) in the archive!!!
